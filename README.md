# vlang-example

Just testing stuf here :D

Vlang is an new langage inspired by Go. It is in Alpha stage. Also lot of work needs to be done to  have a functionnal and reliable language, it is very appealing.

# My review of Vlang as of 30 OCt 2021 : 
After doing a few LOCs I personnaly really like the improvementents on known shortcomings of GO which is already a 10 years old language after all! Vlang is in very active developpement but will need at least 2 more years to complet.
My favoris are things such as :
- Proper error handling
- Memory management with little Garbage Collection (hopefully)
- Direct C compatibility. 

C compatibility open doors to way more applications.Where as in real life GO is only for back end server. GO bottom line is just another PHP/node-JS/Ruby but way faster and maintainable. For example GO has never had a proper UI library in 10 years ! GO will not be used in gaming programmation, system dev, has problem with WASM because of garbage collection. Problem with embedded because of GC.

# Visitors are back !
Visitors are people coming from 'outaspace'... mostely unfriendly guys riding flying saucers...    
It's also a naive lib to search an inverted index :D
Build using the V language Vlang. In order to test this new developing language.
